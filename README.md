# Predicting Road Accident Risk - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the code and resources for the Kaggle Playground Series competition (October 2025), focused on predicting the likelihood of road accidents.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts `accident_risk` (a continuous value between 0 and 1) based on various road and environmental features. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world conditions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project utilizes two main data sources, which are combined for model training:

1.  **Competition Dataset:** The primary synthetic dataset provided by the Kaggle competition, containing over 500,000 samples.
2.  **External Dataset:** The original [Simulated Roads Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ianktoo/simulated-road-accident-data) from which the competition data was derived. This dataset contains an additional 100,000 samples.
